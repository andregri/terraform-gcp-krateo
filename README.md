# Terraform Module to provision Krateo on a GKE Cluster

This repo is a fork of [Learn Terraform - Provision a GKE Cluster repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-provision-gke-cluster) related to the [Provision a GKE Cluster tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/kubernetes/gke), containing Terraform configuration files to provision an GKE cluster on GCP.

This sample repo also creates a VPC and subnet for the GKE cluster. This is not
required but highly recommended to keep your GKE cluster isolated.
